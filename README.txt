to run the application use 'npm start'

project runs with npm and its packages.
express, body-parser, handlebars, mongodb, bycrypt, cokokie-parser, sessions, etc.

comments, help page, score changes, questions and answers were all to be included in extra features, and time did not permit to execute all of it,
we tried implementing comments for help page, if you run just that file it works perfectly, however it is not integrated with the frontend as of now.
